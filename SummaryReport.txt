To implement IDA*, I modified the DFS search agent that is built into OpenNERO. I changed the adjacency lists (which function as lists of open nodes) to be sorted by the heuristic (manhattan distance). This change means that when the DFS algorithm is choosing which branch to explore first, it will choose the most promising one first. Next, I implemented a bound for the heuristic. This involves initalizing the bound on start to the heuristic at the starting position. Then, as the agent begins choosing actions, I exclude potential branches whose f(n) is greater than the bound by not adding them to the adjacency list. As I exclude these branches, I keep track of the minimum f(n) of excluded branches. If the algorithm backtracks to the start and has no more options, I then restart the search with an increased bound of the mimnimum f(n) that was excluded as tracked from the previous run.
